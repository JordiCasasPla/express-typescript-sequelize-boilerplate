# Express TypeScript Boilerplate with Sequelize

Welcome to the **Express TypeScript Boilerplate**! This project is built on top of Express and TypeScript and includes Sequelize as the ORM. It is designed to be a starting point for building robust and scalable applications with a strong focus on modularity, maintainability, and best practices.

## üöÄ Features

- **Express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- **Sequelize**: A promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.

## üõ†Ô∏è Work in Progress

This project is currently under active development. The following features are being implemented:

- **Services**: Centralized logic for handling business rules.
- **Test Setup**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests using Jest.
- **Models**: Database models created using Sequelize.
- **Authentication**: OAuth-based authentication system.

## üìö Based on

This boilerplate is heavily inspired by [hagopj13's Node Express Boilerplate](https://github.com/hagopj13/node-express-boilerplate). If you find this project useful, please consider giving a ‚≠ê to his repository as well. A lot of the foundational code and structure has been adapted from his excellent work.
